BLOCK CIPHER PRINCIPLES & ALGORITHMS:
* Plain text is divided into a number of blocks
* Block size can be 40,56,64,128,256 bits
* Plain text block size = Cipher text block size
* The corresponding cipher text is obtained by applying some key 'k' onto the plain text blocks

Block Cipher Principles:
1. Number of Rounds - eg: 10R, 16R, 20R depending on the algorithm. Higheer the number of rounds, tougher it is to break the encryption.
2. Design of function F - Design a function that is difficult 
3. Key schedule algorithm - Be careful when generating the key

Modes of Operation of Block cipher:
1. ECB - Electronic code book
2. CBC - Cipher block chaining
3. CFB - Cipher feedback mode
4. OFB - Output feedback mode
5. CTR - Counter mode

Block Cipher Algorithms:
1. DES
2. AES
3. Blowfish
